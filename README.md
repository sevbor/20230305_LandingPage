Usability

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
A Responsive layout of the landing page should be created to use across all devices.
Make sure that the navigation bar is responsive too across all these devices.
Responsiveness can be verified by inspecting the landing page using the Developer Tools option on Google Chrome Browser.


eg. project description, usage, dependencies, and use correct the markdown syntax.
